# 6 Algorithms Every Developer Should Know

# 1. Sorting Algorithm:
- It is the algorithm that arranges the order of the items in a list.

Bubble Sort
Merge Sort
Quicksort
Heap Sort

# 2. Searching Algorithm:
- It is the algorithm that finds an element in a data set.

Binary Search
Breadth-First Search(BFS)
Depth-First Search(DFS)

# 3. Dynamic Programming:
- DP is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems.

# 4. Recursion Algorithm:
- Recursion is a problem-solving technique in which the solution is dependent on solutions
to smaller instances of the same problem.

# 5. Divide and Conquer:
- The Divide and Conquer algorithm consists of a dispute using the three steps listed below.

* Divide the original problem into sub-problems.
* Conquer: Solve each sub-problem one at a time, recursively.
* Combine: Put the solutions to the sub-problems together to get the solution to the whole problem.
