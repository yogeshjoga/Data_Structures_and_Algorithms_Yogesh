Note this extremely practical hack. âœ¨
When youâ€™re solving problems online, talk to yourself OUT LOUD. Explain your approach to solving each of those problems. As youâ€™re doing it, record yourself.
Through this hack, not only youâ€™ll be able to time yourself but also hear your responses later. If you hear objectively enough, youâ€™ll be able to note down some of the errors you made while speaking. This is like hitting two birds with one stone - practise coding and thinking out loud simultaneously.
Not referring to only grammatical errors here - because they can often get overlooked as long as your approach is correct and it helps you reach a viable solution.
But the possible mistakes you make can go against you, are the overall manner and tone of speech, the general flow of solving problems step by step, and being vocally descriptive of those steps.
