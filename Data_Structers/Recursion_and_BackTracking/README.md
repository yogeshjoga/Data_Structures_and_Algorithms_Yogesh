# Recursion
```java
        Recursive algorithms have two types fo cases, recursive case and base case
        Every recursive function case must terminate at a base case
        Examples Algorithms of Recursion :
             -Fiboncacci series, Factorial finding
             -Merge sort, Quick sort
             -Binary search
             -Tree traversals and many problems: InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder.
             -Graph Traversals :DFS /BFS
             -Dynamic programming 
             -Divide and Conquer Algorithms
             -Towers of Hanoi
             -Backtracking Algorithms
 very importent Recursion take it serious
